#generativeai #datamodelling #python #amazonbedrock #compliance #regulatoryreporting

**Introduction**

Intelligent automation of business process operations has come to the force as a future-oriented function in the financial services industry, ultimately aimed at improving user experience, efficiency and precision. This hands-on and demo project will show how to implement a practical risk and compliance monitoring platform, assisted by generative AI, which may help a financial organisation to manage and mitigate risks, while ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements and internal policies.


**Specifications**

1. Build a robust suspicious transaction report (STR) generation platform.
2. The compliance framework is shaped up by using AWS generative AI foundation models (FMs) for STR drafts combined with knowledge bases (e.g., fraudulent activities) powered by vector databases to enhance prompt engineering and to be intelligently used by Amazon Bedrock agents.
3. Sample data consist of account information and transaction details.
4. The reports generated will be excel files.
